Hello! I'm Nishan Ghimire, a passionate learner stepping into the world of coding. Currently, I am exploring front-end development and enjoying every bit of creating interactive and visually appealing websites. Coding has opened up a whole new creative outlet for me, and I love experimenting with new technologies and designs.


Apart from coding, I am a huge fan of anime and video games, which inspire me to think creatively and immerse myself in different stories and characters. This portfolio is one of my practice projects, and it represents my growing skills in web development.


Feel free to explore my work, and check out my website creation: https://opticeessence.netlify.app/. There's more to come as I continue to learn and improve!

Feel free to reach out if you want to connect, collaborate, or just chat about tech, anime, or gaming!
